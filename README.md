Create a weather dashboard that displays today’s forecast and a weekly forecast. Guidelines for this dashboard are as follows.

-              The dashboard MUST be built using Next.js and Typescript.
-              The dashboard MUST bring in data from a weather api. You can use any api of your choosing
  (My choice: https://openweathermap.org/)
-              This dashboard may be styled however you like.
-              The dashboard can have as many tabs or pages as you would like.
-              You may use any component libraries you would like.
-              You may use TailwindCSS.
-              CSS preprocessors like SASS are allowed.
-              You may use any assets you have access to or find on the internet such as https://fonts.google.com/icons.
-              Have fun with it! You may add in any additional things, even if it’s not tied to the weather.
